```
All transactions on Solana use Compute Units (CU), which measure the computational resources your transaction uses on the network. When you pay priority fees on your transactions, you must specify the exact amount of compute units you expect to use; otherwise, you will overpay for your transaction. This guide will provide step-by-step instructions on optimizing the compute units for your transaction requests.
